Usually. That is, I keep returning to it.
For the last few years, using Linux meant using Gnome 3. It&amp;rsquo;s not bad as such, except that it uses far too many resources for things I think don&amp;rsquo;t have to use that many resources.
Also, it keeps losing functionality I like. One such is moving windows by dragging anywhere on them while Alt is pressed.</description></item></channel></rss>
