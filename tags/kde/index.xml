First, it looks consistent for the first time in years.
Then, its shell is written in something else than Javascript, and it looks like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the mad memory leaks GNOME&amp;rsquo;s Mutter is famous for.
And then, it&amp;rsquo;s not bloated, and seems to do the right thing with multi-monitor configurations.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t yet tried it under Wayland, but I expect it to perform there as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
