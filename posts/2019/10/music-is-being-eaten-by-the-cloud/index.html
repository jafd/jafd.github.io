&#x5d;</div></header><article><p>The other day I tried to put my music collection onto some kind of NAS so I could use it from any computer on my network.</p><p>It turned out, that while it wasn&rsquo;t much of a problem finding a <em>server</em> to index and serve the music directory over the network, finding a client that is not ancient was more trouble.</p><p>Ironically, Apple&rsquo;s own DAAP protocol is not supported by anything produced by Apple anymore. Anything still alive, anyway. iTunes is dead, and Apple&rsquo;s Music.app thinks of your local collection, be it locally or on the network, as an afterthought at best. Rhythmbox does support it, so my Linux machines can use it, but the usability of Rhythmbox itself leaves some things to be desired.</p><p>VLC doesn&rsquo;t support DAAP since a long ago. They deprecated and removed the support because the library they were using got bitrotten, but never came back. A lot of internets will happily give you outdated information that VLC still supports DAAP. It doesn&rsquo;t. It, however, seems to support DLNA, so at least this is covered.</p><p>VLC&rsquo;s searching abilities, though, are abysmal. You need to scroll a lot on mobile, and expand and scroll on desktop. Oh, and it&rsquo;s unable to sort by track number within albums. Double bummer.</p><p>Rhythmbox, however, doesn&rsquo;t seem to support DLNA/uPNP, so I have to keep both <code>minidlna</code> and <code>forked-daapd</code> running. Oh well.</p><p>An older Mac which cannot run anything beyond High Sierra still has iTunes, so it can use DAAP.</p><p>The list of players supporting DLNA and DAAP on Wikipedia is longish, but 99% of them have &ldquo;discontinued&rdquo; somewhere in their description.</p><p>There is one nice thing to be said of iTunes, despite it being &ldquo;bloated&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t experience any of the bloat, but it was superior in managing 20,000+ pieces of music in my collection. The collection was searchable. And the songs within albums were ordered how their authors wanted them to be. It also had nice tools to manage tags. Now I&rsquo;d need to reassemble my toolbox yet again, because usage patterns like mine don&rsquo;t seem to be common any longer.</p><p>People lean very heavily towards the cloud and streaming services, and while those are convenient, you don&rsquo;t really own your collection anymore. It&rsquo;s subject to whatever contracts music publishers have with streaming services, and you can have all sorts of trouble, like your music suddenly disappearing because you are in another country, or because a contract has expired. Nothing is stable anymore. Not to say that you have to be connected all the time.</p><p>Having a local collection of music (I have a lot of niche recordings which will never get onto the clouds â€” I can tell, I made some of them) has a lot of advantages, but it&rsquo;s a pity that tooling around it is getting scarce and user-hostile.</p></article></div><div class=footer><div class=footer-links><a href=https://github.com/jafd>GitHub</a>
