Nice try, but not good enough until they actually clarify that in their terms of protection from fraudulent sites, which still say the same as before:</p><blockquote><p>Before visiting a website, Safari may send information calculated from the website address to Google Safe Browsing and Tencent Safe Browsing to check if the website is fraudulent. These safe browsing providers may also log your IP address.</p></blockquote><p>As one can see by just reading this text, there are no preconditions whatsoever. Apple&rsquo;s PR team may say whatever they like, but it&rsquo;s worth nothing until it actually lands in the binding documents. When I&rsquo;m using Apple&rsquo;s devices and check the checkboxes in their systems, I don&rsquo;t agree to be bound by the PR statements, but by what&rsquo;s quoted above. What&rsquo;s above says that there is no Google Safe Browsing OR Tencent. It says Google AND Tencent. It doesn&rsquo;t clarify at which point the decision is being made to whom my data goes, and doesn&rsquo;t mention mainland China.</p><p>When in doubt, you just take any Terms of Service provisions literally. Imagine the worst possible scenario which a company may implement while still following the letter of its terms, or law, for that matter. Any wiggle room there is, any kind of evil scenario there is, can, and will be used eventually. This is how it should be treated. Companies are not exactly known by the kindness of their hearts or &ldquo;the spirit&rdquo; of anything, when push comes to shove.</p></article></div><div class=footer><div class=footer-links><a href=https://github.com/jafd>GitHub</a>
